/*
 Write a Person class with an instance variable,age, and a constructor that takes an integer, initialAge, as a
 parameter. The constructor must assign initialAge to age  after confirming the argument passed as initialAge  is 
 not negative; if a negative argument is passed as initialAge, the constructor should set age to 0 and print  age 
 is not valid, setting age to 0.In addition, you must write the following instance methods:
 
 1.)yearPasses() should increase the age instance variable by 1.
 2.)amIOld() should perform the following conditional actions:
   *If age<13, print You are young.
   *If  age>13 and age<18 , print You are a teenager.
   *Otherwise, print You are old.
